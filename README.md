# pregasm
Pre GNU Assembler Code Bank

## Introduction
This is an x86 assembly code base. It currently houses the assembly language examples from Richard Detmer's assembly language book. I called it pre-gasm because I may have considered writing an assembler and this being the preliminary code base for that. However, I will probably just make it a repository for the things listed in tasks and rename it.

## Tasks
I have the following objectives for this repository
- Assembly implementation of leet code
- Translation of Detmer's source for GNU assembler
- Implementation of inline assembly
- Implementation of parallel algorithms using inline assembly and OpenMP
